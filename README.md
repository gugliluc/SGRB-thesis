In this repository, the lightcurves obtained from the analysis performed in the paper Guglielmi et al. (submitted) are reported to allow the reader to inspect them.
To facilitate the reader, these are devided in folders. The content of each folder is briefly described in the following.


%%%% bpl_lightcurve directory

In this directory, the lightcurves og the 15 SGRB for which the fit with a broken powerlaw (BPL) was found to be more statistically significant than a powerlaw are reported.
In black one can see the BAT data in the range 15-150 keV (just for reference) while in red the XRT data in the range 0.3-10 keV on which the analysis was performed.




%%%% pl_lightcurve directory

In this directory, the lightcurves og the 25 SGRB for which the fit with a simple powerlaw (PL) was found to be more statistically significant than a powerlaw are reported.
In black one can see the BAT data in the range 15-150 keV (just for reference) while in red the XRT data in the range 0.3-10 keV on which the analysis was performed.



%%%% magnetar_lightcurve directory

In this directory, the lightcurves of the 13 SGRBs for which it was possible to fit the rest frame lightcurve using the magnetar model are presented.
The ones with a red fit are the ones for which a steep decay component is present, preceeding the afterglow.
The ones with a green fit are the ones for which only the aferglow componet is present.

The fitting procedure and best fit parameters are presented in a dedicated paper (Guglielmi et al. , submitted, Tab.3).

The data used to do these fits can be found in https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bBxPvkCD1KCPBd8iyBz3X30h8N8G6Ira?usp=share_link
