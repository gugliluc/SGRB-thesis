In this repository, the lightcurves of the 13 SGRBs for which it was possible to fit the rest frame lightcurve using the magnetar model are presented.

The ones with a red fit are the ones for which a steep decay component is present, preceeding the afterglow.

The ones with a green fit are the ones for which only the aferglow componet is present.

The fitting procedure and best fit parameters are presented in a dedicated paper (Guglielmi et al. , submitted, Tab.3).

The data used to do these fits can be found in https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bBxPvkCD1KCPBd8iyBz3X30h8N8G6Ira?usp=share_link
