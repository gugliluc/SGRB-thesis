In this repository, the lightcurves of the 13 SGRBs for which it was possible to fit the rest frame lightcurve using the magnetar model are presented.

The ones with a red fit are the ones for which a steep decay component is present, preceeding the afterglow.

The ones with a green fit are the ones for which only the aferglow componet is present.

The best fit parameters are published in the paper Guglielmi et. al 2024
The data used to do this fits can be found in https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bBxPvkCD1KCPBd8iyBz3X30h8N8G6Ira?usp=share_link
